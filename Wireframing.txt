Wireframing: sketch>mockup>prototype

Wireframes are visual representations of an interface, used to communicate the following details to get everyone on the same page:

• Structure - How will the pieces of this site be put together?
• Content - What will be displayed on the site?
• Informational hierarchy - How is this information organized and displayed?
• Functionality - How will this interface work?
• Behavior - How does it interact with the user? And how does it behave?

DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR WIREFRAMING

A few questions that you may want to answer before jumping too far into the details:
• Who are the core users?
• What are the user needs and goals?
• What are the business needs and goals?
• What existing product or design patterns work for your users and business?
• What are the gaps in what’s currently out there?
• What are some product requirements you have given your users needs and goals
(as well as those of your business?
• What are your constraints (i.e. time, resources, money, skills)?

Set expectations - not just goals

Start with users - and their needs
	“Who is going to use my product and what will he or she do first?”

	What users ask for is not always what they need

Think how, not what
	• What is needed for your product to function well?
	• How much can you take away from it without sacrificing the core product?
	• Why will people be excited about it?

	Understand when you are working on your core product and when you are working on adding features.
	Minimum + Viable = Good products for statups to build

Start simple, stay simple
	"Simplicity is the ultimate for of sophistication" - Leo Da Vinci

Shipped is better than perfect
	The goal of sketching, wireframing and prototyping is delivering great product concepts, not great deliverables.
